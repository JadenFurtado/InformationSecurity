# Password Cracking 


### Password cracking tools

* [Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) - 
Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility

* [John The Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) - 
John the Ripper is designed to be both feature-rich and fast. It combines several cracking modes in one program and is fully configurable for your particular needs (you can even define a custom cracking mode using the built-in compiler supporting a subset of C). Also, John is available for several different platforms which enables you to use the same cracker everywhere

* [THC-Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) - 
Hydra is a parallelized password cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add. This tool makes it possible for researchers and security consultants to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a system remotely

* [Ncrack](https://nmap.org/ncrack/) - 
Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts. 


### Wordlist Generators

* [The mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist) - 
Mentalist is a graphical tool for custom wordlist generation. It utilizes common human paradigms for constructing passwords and can output the full wordlist as well as rules compatible with Hashcat and John the Ripper. 

* [Crunch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/) - 
Crunch is a wordlist generator where you can specify a standard character set or a character set you specify. crunch can generate all possible combinations and permutations.

* [CeWL](https://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php) -
CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.


### Credential Checking tools
* [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) -
Find credentials everywhere
